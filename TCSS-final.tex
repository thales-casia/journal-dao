\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The academic publishing industry is currently undergoing significant growth but also faces several challenges, mainly including the lack of transparency in the peer review process and the limited rights of authors. The rise of Web3, emphasizing decentralization, openness, and user control over data, opens up new perspectives for academic publishing. This article introduces an innovative academic publishing model, named Journal DAO, leveraging emerging Web3 technologies such as blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). First, by recording articles on the blockchain rather than a specific database, Journal DAO can ensure data security and traceability of the articles. Second, through the governance framework of DAO, tokens are distributed among all the participants of Journal DAO based on the their contributions, safeguarding the rights of each role in the publishing process. Third, effective incentive mechanisms are proposed to reward all participants, ensuring the sustainability of the framework and its autonomous functionality. This work proposes a prospective academic publishing model that aims to reshape the industry through the application of blockchain and DAO in Web3, making a significant contribution to future academic publishing.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} academic publishing industry is currently facing several pressing challenges. First, the traditional system, often conducted anonymously, fails to ensure fairness and impartiality, leading to a compromised review process that undermines both credibility and integrity. This lack of transparency can undermine the credibility and integrity of the review process. Second,
the authors often lack control over associated data of their articles, since the ownership often rests with publishers or electronic databases. This challenges authors in retaining rights, deciding on data use, and hampers their ability to fully leverage research, limiting collaborative opportunities and further advancements in their field. Third, the restrictions on data sharing hinder the free flow of knowledge and inhibit potential collaborations, which limits authors from fully benefiting and making discoveries that could contribute to the scientific community.

The emergence of technologies such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) \cite{buterin2014next} and blockchain \cite{swan2015blockchain,9093840} presents significant opportunities for the advancement of the academic publishing industry. DAOs offer a groundbreaking approach to organizational governance, decision-making, and fund management for academic publishing \cite{wang2019decentralized}. Unlike traditional hierarchical structures, DAOs operate without central authorities, relying on transparent and automated processes governed by smart contracts and consensus protocols \cite{kaal2021decentralized}. This decentralization can provide a transparent and auditable decision-making process, enhance accountability, and facilitate efficient funds distribution for the current academic publishing system. The decentralized and tamper-resistant nature of blockchain can provide a secure and transparent environment for intelligent journals. By integrating blockchain technology into intelligent journals, the data transparency and authenticity can be realized. Through blockchain-based smart contracts, the reliability of data can be steadfastly guaranteed, thereby eliminating the necessity for third-party oversight \cite{mougayar2016business}. This innovative approach not only enhances the credibility of information but also streamlines the process, fostering trust and efficiency within the realm of intelligent journals.

In the literature, the applications of blockchain-based decentralized technologies in academic publishing have received researchers' great attention \cite{8756390}. Blockchain technology was used to solve the security and efficiency concerns in the distribution and management of open journal systems, ensuring precise distribution, enhancing reputation and trust, and safeguarding paper management against potential hacker threats \cite{agustin2020blockchain}. Through decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and blockchain technologies, the authenticity, trust and reliability of online publications can be ensured, which can effectively address the challenges related to security and privacy in online publications \cite{nizamuddin2018ipfs}. By leveraging blockchain-based decentralized technologies, a decentralized scientific publishing platform is established, which utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to expedite the publication process, reduce biases in peer review, and lower publication costs \cite{becstacs2023novel}. The platform can ensure complete traceability throughout the publication processes, and all the participants including the editors, reviewers, and authors will receive system tokens as rewards for their contributions.

However, these existing studies primarily concentrate on specific aspects, such as the use of blockchain to address security and efficiency concerns or enhance transparency in the academic publishing process. They do not comprehensively address the multifaceted challenges prevalent in the current academic publishing landscape. This article proposes an innovative academic publishing model called Journal DAO, which applies emerging Web3 technologies, such as blockchain and DAO, to address these challenges. First, by recording articles on the blockchain, all operations are conducted on the chain rather than belonging to a specific database, ensuring data security and traceability. Second, through the DAO framework, tokens are distributed based on role contributions, protecting the rights of researchers. Third, by designing effective incentive mechanisms, with the consideration of rewarding each participant according to their contributions to the article, which can realize a fully autonomous and economically sustainable Journal DAO ecosystem \cite{ding2022desci}.

The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section \ref{sec:framework} introduces the framework of Journal DAO framework. Section \ref{sec:mechanism} discusses the design and implementation of the incentive mechanism in Journal DAO. Section \ref{sec:performance} presents experimental results validating the effectiveness of the implemented incentive mechanism.
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.
